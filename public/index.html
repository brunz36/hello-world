      The internet has been a part of my life since I was 10 years old and my parents bought me a Compaq Presario. It had 4mb of ram and a 2800kb modem. Those numbers are laughable now but I couldn’t be more excited that birthday. I remember those early days of <a href="http://aol.com" id="aol" target="_blank">AOL</a> and how connected I felt to the world. I would spend hours on it playing games and talking to strangers in chat rooms. Then I remember my friend telling me about this program called Netscape…this was new and very exciting. I was always a trouble maker so I immediately gravitated towards warez sites. This truly started my love affair with the web. I could have any information and program in just a few minutes or hours.

      The internet has always represented freedom for me. To me it could be anything I wanted it to be. A tool for learning and positive influences or a destructive weapon. From an early stage I was attracted to the destructive nature of it. Feeling like a I was a part of a secret group just because I read the Anarchist Cookbook and had a little fun on <a href="http://aol.com" id="aol" target="blank">AOL</a>. As I matured so did the internet, this budding place become a safer place to connect with others and to actually do something productive.

      The internet, at least for us in the United States is ingrained into our lives. Every facet of our lives these days is shaped by IOT. From everything we do to groceries, communication, and our homes is connected is some way or another. This has been a great development in how we interact with each other. Overall the internet has brought humanity closer together but we must be wary as to not place too much trust in these information systems that are woefully insecure. The scary aspect is that there will less privacy due to the nature all the systems we’ve created so far, as in they have flaws and exploits. With human nature being what it is there will be individuals throughout the world the will exploit these systems for fun, boredom or malicious reasons. I feel our world is ever shrinking and soon we will be able to truly to connect to anyone in the world. The internet won’t be a something we log on to but just be part of everyone’s lives. It will touch all aspects of our lives in every corner of the world.
